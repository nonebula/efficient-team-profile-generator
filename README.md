# efficient-team-profile-generator
This is a functional Node.js command-line application designed to gather information about team members in a software engineering team and generate an HTML webpage displaying summaries for each person.

## Description 
The primary objective of this project was to create a command-line application using Node.js to collect user input and dynamically generate team cards based on that input. The application incorporates Jest testing to ensure the fulfillment of design goals.

Given the project's nature, no additional HTML or CSS elements were created, and the provided starter template was used without additional formatting. Consequently, the README file is displayed on the homepage.

## Credits

The project was completed independently but built off the source code from: edX Boot Camps LLC. I worked with a friend, Sam Millar, to explore the fundamentals of Javascript and clarify my work. I also worked through the modules on Codecademy to better develop my understanding to enable me to solve these challenges. In producing this webpage, I also utilized a range of tutorials from W3 Schools and referred to multiple posts on Stack Overflow.
